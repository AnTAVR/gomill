The Gomill library
==================

Gomill is intended to be useful as a Python library for developing |gtp|- and
|sgf|-based tools.

As of Gomill |version|, much of the library API is not formally documented.
Only the parts which are described in this documentation should be considered
stable public interfaces.

Nonetheless, the remaining source files contain fairly detailed documentation,
and the :doc:`example scripts <example_scripts>` illustrate how some of then
can be used.
