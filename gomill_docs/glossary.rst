  GTP
    The Go Text Protocol

    A communication protocol used to control Go-playing programs. Gomill
    uses only GTP version 2, which is specified at
    http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html.

    (As of October 2010, the specification describes itself as a draft, but it
    has remained stable for several years and is widely implemented.)
