Tournament results API
----------------------

.. todo:: introduction

.. class:: Tournament_results

   A Tournament_results object provides access to the results of a single
   tournament.

   The tournament results are catalogued in terms of :dfn:`matchups`, with
   each matchup corresponding to a pair of players. Each matchup has an id,
   which is a short string.

   Tournament_results objects are normally retrieved from :class:`Competition`
   or :class:`Ringmaster` objects.

   Tournament_results objects support the following methods:

   .. method:: get_matchup_ids()

      Return a list of all the tournament's matchup ids.

   .. method:: get_matchup(matchup_id)

      Return a :class:`Matchup_description` describing the matchup with the
      specified id.

   .. method:: get_matchups()

      Return a map *matchup id* â†’ :class:`Matchup_description`, describing all
      matchups.

   .. method:: get_matchup_results(matchup_id)

      Return the individual game results for the matchup with the specified id.

      Returns a list of :class:`~gtp_games.Game_results` objects.

      The list is in unspecified order (in particular, the colours don't
      necessarily alternate, even if :attr:`alternating` is True for the
      matchup).

   .. method:: get_matchup_stats(matchup_id)

      Return a :class:`Matchup_stats` object containing statistics for the
      matchup with the specified id.


.. class:: Matchup_description

   A Matchup_description describes a series of games which had the same
   players and settings.

   Matchup_descriptions are normally retrieved from
   :class:`Tournament_results` objects.

   Matchup_descriptions have the following attributes (which should be treated
   as read-only):

   .. attribute:: id

      The :ref:`matchup id <matchup id>` (a string, usually 1 to 3 characters)

   .. attribute:: p1

      The :ref:`player code <player codes>` of the first player

   .. attribute:: p2

      The :ref:`player code <player codes>` of the second player

   :attr:`!p1` and :attr:`!p2` are always different.

   .. todo:: Explain that they match the Game_results. Explain about #2 stuff.


   .. attribute:: name

      String describing the matchup (eg ``xxx v yyy``)

   .. attribute:: board_size

      Integer (eg ``19``)

   .. attribute:: komi

      Float (eg ``7.0``)

   .. attribute:: alternating

      Bool. If this is False, :attr:`p1` played black and :attr:`p2` played
      white; otherwise they alternated.

   .. attribute:: handicap

      Integer or ``None``

   .. attribute:: handicap_style

      String: ``fixed`` or ``free``

   .. attribute:: move_limit

      Integer or ``None``. See :ref:`playing games`.

   .. attribute:: scorer

      String: ``internal`` or ``players``. See :ref:`scoring`.

   .. attribute:: number_of_games

      Integer or ``None``. This is the number of games requested in the
      control file; it may not match the number of game results that are
      available.


   Matchup_descriptions support the following method:

   .. method:: describe_details()

      Return a text description of the matchup's game settings.

      This covers the most important game settings which can't be observed in
      the results table (board size, handicap, and komi).
